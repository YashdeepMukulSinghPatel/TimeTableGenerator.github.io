## Introduction : 🫵
---
This java program generates time table based on certain rules.

---
## rules 🎯
---
⏭️ A Teacher has a maximum of 2 lectures in a day.

⏭️ A Teacher can take a maximum of 1 lecture in a particular class in a day.

⏭️ A Teacher can take a maximum of 2 lectures in a particular class in a week.

⏭️ A Class has a maximum of 3 lectures in a day.

---
## note ⚠️
---
Teachers, their Courses, and Classes are hardcoded. 
They all are stored in their specific Arrays. 
But you can change the data to use that program for your needs.

---
## flow 👉
When the program starts to execute, it asks how many Rooms are available and their capacity.
And asks the capacity of the Classes.

---
## what it does

#### It checks that whether at a particular time slot:

⏭️ A particular Teacher is free

⏭️ A particular Class is free

⏭️Any room is available

⏭️ If a room is available, would it have the capacity to fit the class in?

 Considering all these checks and the above rule program generates a timetable 🚩.
 At the end, the program also displays the Classes that are unable to take all their lectures.
